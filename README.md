You will always launch from bat's acquired in step 2 (1), unless you modify url to be from the standard repo, then you have a choice of continuing to grab custom ui from next step, and it changes how you'd launch.

# 6. 
If you want to use official repo change bat url from this repo to https://github.com/RVC-Project/Retrieval-based-Voice-Conversion-WebUI and if you want the modifications i did after, manually go to https://github.com/Enrop/RVC-Edits/tree/NotPrebuilt press code, download as zip, and unzip in the final install, launch from EnropStart.bat

if you care for realtime and dont want to install everything else, just use okada either from following https://rentry.co/VoiceChangerGuide this guide, and or felts github repo that installs it manually listed here https://github.com/MrFelt/voice-changer
